						<h1>UX Design</h1>
						<p><u>Problem</u><br>When creating UIs for a game, it involves research on the game they’re making and understanding the style the game is going for. I’ve included two different game UI that I created tests for below. One was for a visual novel game in the style of a comic book. The other was for a cartoon style mining game.
						</p>
						<p><u>Insight</u><br>In the visual novel game, I did research on some classic comic book looks. The color theme of yellow became apparent very quickly, along with asymmetric lines and the use of dot textures.<p> With the mining game, keeping with the cartoon look became key. 
							</p>
						<p><u>Approach</u><br>I created several iterations of UIs possible for the visual novel game. I made sure to include text boxes that invoked different emotions and functions. I also included various styles of line work and image boxes for the client to choose from.
							<p>For the mining game, I kept with a cartoonish look to create a UI that resembled rock or gems. These more finished versions were after I had created several sketches for the client to nail down the image they were thinking of.
							</p>
						<p><u>Solution</u><br>By creating several styles I was able to better understand what the client was looking for in each instance. I used Adobe Illustrator for both games, which allows for quick adjustments and better use for in-game functions.
						</p>
						<p><u>Result/Outcome</u><br>As a whole, these turned out really well. I was able to capture the direction and core style of the games the client was looking for.
