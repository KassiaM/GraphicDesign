						<h1>Fractured Rogue - Logo Design/Branding</h1>
						<p><u>Problem</u><br>I created the brand logo for Fractured Rogue Studios, LLC. They approached me wanting a specific look that invoked a sense of teamwork but also kept the idea of “fractured” that is part of their name. 
						</p>
						<p><u>Insight</u><br>I work with the team, so I had a good idea of what they were looking for, but I still made sure to speak to each member and find out what is important about the brand and their name that they wanted to convey. They were a team that discovered themselves at another studio and, with that studio’s blessing, ended up branching off to create their own studio. They described it as ‘going rogue’ and ‘fracturing off’. Their origin story is important to the team.
						</p>
						<p><u>Approach</u><br>After speaking to each member, I researched other studios and their logos and brands. The gaming industry is varied in its logo and brands, which allows for<br> a lot more creativity. The key aspect is recognition. It needed to be simple enough that it can be recognized at a glance, but also could be more creative than other industries.
						</p>
						<p><u>Solution</u><br>I chose the look of stained-glass, as it is fractal but together it creates a bigger idea or picture. I chose six colors to represent each of the original six team members. I originally had brighter colors but after several discussions with the team it became more muted. I used Adobe Illustrator to create it.
						</p>
						<p><u>Result/Outcome</u><br>As a result the image quickly became brand recognition for the community they’ve built up. It has been featured in their games, social media, and merch. It is a logo that can be transitioned to many different media easily.
