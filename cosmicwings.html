						<h1>Cosmic Wings</h1>
						<p><u>Problem</u><br>Cosmic Wings is a fictional brand I created for myself as part of a student portfolio. The goal was to create a look that is unique to me and captures who I am. As someone who has a variety of different art styles that I am drawn to, this became a challenge to find a look that speaks to me and that would stand out to a possible customer.
						</p>
						<p><u>Insight</u><br>I had to take a deep look at both myself and my potential customer base. I chose the name Cosmic Wings because I love space and the potential of it as well as the freedom of flight. These two images together to me creates a sense of forever reaching for the next great idea and endless creativity.
						</p>
						<p><u>Approach</u><br>I started with initial research on typography, various art looks of collages, and possible customers. I found certain free-to-use images that I could incorporate. Then I worked in Adobe Photoshop to combine these ideas together and create its own look.
						</p>
						<p><u>Solution</u><br>I went through several iterations. I wanted a slightly offset look, with the boxes as it’s own look but everything outside of it to emphasize the idea of thinking outside the box. I included looks that invoked the imagery of worlds inside the world. Throughout it all, I kept the theme of wings in different forms to show all the different ways we can explore. 
						</p>
						<p><u>Result/Outcome</u><br>Overall I am pleased with the look. I considered a lot when creating these concepts and I feel in many ways it landed well. If I created it now, I would have given more space to some of the concepts so it didn’t look as busy, as well as adding a thicker outline to the font so it stands out better.
