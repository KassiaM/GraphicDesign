						<h1>Pictord</h1>
						<p><u>Problem</u><br>Fractured Rogue Studios was hired to create a web-based html game called Pictoid. It was my job to create all the UI and splash screens for the game. This was the first time the team worked with another studio to create their clientâ€™s vision. It involved a lot of communication and patience to make sure their vision came to life. The problem was, the client did not have a vision that their team agreed on.
						</p>
						<p><u>Insight</u><br>The key aspects of this position was allowing the client to describe their vision clearly while creating several versions of the game to help them narrow down their specific look they were looking for. I created different iterations of the tiles, changed colors, and kept in close communication with our director as our go-between.
						</p>
						<p><u>Approach</u><br>Communication was key in this role. As I was not able to speak directly to the client, I kept in constant contact with our Director to understand the needs of our client. 
						</p>
						<p><u>Solution</u><br>After the client decided on their look, they provided us with a graphic design document that detailed their specific colors and style they were going for. I recreated that look exactly in the form of the tiles and the splash pages.
						</p>
						<p><u>Result/Outcome</u><br>I believe the overall look of the game turned out well. The core look of the game was the simple and clean concept they requested.
